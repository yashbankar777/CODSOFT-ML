📱 SMS Spam Detection Using NLP & Machine Learning
🧠 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a spam detection system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and supervised machine learning models. The dataset consists of thousands of SMS messages labeled as either ham (not spam) or spam. The main goal is to classify incoming messages as spam or ham based on the message content.

📊 Key Features
🔍 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and text normalization applied to prepare raw text for analysis.

📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn to understand class distributions and data balance.

✂️ Feature Engineering

CountVectorizer for Bag-of-Words model

TfidfVectorizer for TF-IDF representation

🤖 Machine Learning Models
Trained and tested Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier using both BoW and TF-IDF approaches.

✅ Evaluation Metrics
Used accuracy to compare the performance of vectorization techniques.
